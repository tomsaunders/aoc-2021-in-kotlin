# aoc-2021-in-kotlin

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [tomsaunders][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

I'm going to use some personal development time at work to practice [Kotlin][kotlin] by doing some Advent of Code puzzles. And maybe win a random prize.

I am on twitter as [@tomsaunders][twitter] and that's the account I use for AoC login. 

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
    Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
    A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
